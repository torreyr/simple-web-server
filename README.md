This program creates a server and allows a client to send GET requests using UDP.

Syntax:
./sws \<port\> \<directory\>

NOTE: the client request path cannot include "../"
            
My simple web server code is broken up into sections. Namely, server functions, methods used to parse user input, and console output functions.
